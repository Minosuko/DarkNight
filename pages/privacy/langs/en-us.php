    <h2>3. End-to-End Encryption</h2>
    <p>Darknight uses advanced RSA-OAEP and AES-GCM encryption for private messages. This means:</p>

        <li>We cannot read your private messages.</li>
        <li>Your private key is encrypted with your PIN before being stored (if enabled).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement professional-grade security measures to protect your data, including binary-indexed storage for identity vaults and sharded message streams. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your information at any time through the settings panel. If you delete your account, your profile data will be purged, though your public keys may remain associated with previous encrypted message headers to maintain conversation integrity for recipients.</p>

    <h2>6. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.</p>
